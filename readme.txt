From a nmea file (named "dbfile"), use "parser.py" to extract the data in a new file named out.csv.

Then use gpx_maker.py to get the lat, lon, speed, from out.csv and compose a new file named "output.gpx", that you can run on a website like gpx.studio.

NB : I use the speed instead of the elevation in output.gpx. So you can see the speed on gpx.studio in the "profile" section, which is normally used for the elevation.
